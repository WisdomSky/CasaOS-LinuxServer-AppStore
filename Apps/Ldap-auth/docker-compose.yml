    en_us: Ldap-auth software is for authenticating users who request protected resources from servers proxied by nginx. It includes a daemon (ldap-auth) that communicates with an authentication server, and a webserver daemon that generates an authentication cookie based on the user’s credentials. The daemons are written in Python for use with a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) authentication server (OpenLDAP or Microsoft Windows Active Directory 2003 and 2012).
