# Habridge

Emulates Philips Hue API to other home automation gateways such as an Amazon Echo/Dot Gen 1 (gen 2 has issues discovering ha-bridge) or other systems that support Philips Hue. The Bridge handles basic commands such as 'On', 'Off' and 'brightness' commands of the hue protocol. This bridge can control most devices that have a distinct API.
