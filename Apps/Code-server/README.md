# Code server

VS Code running on a remote server, accessible through the browser. - Code on your Chromebook, tablet, and laptop with a consistent dev environment. - If you have a Windows or Mac workstation, more easily develop for Linux. - Take advantage of large cloud servers to speed up tests, compilations, downloads, and more. - Preserve battery life when you're on the go. - All intensive computation runs on your server. - You're no longer running excess instances of Chrome.
