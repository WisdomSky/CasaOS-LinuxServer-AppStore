# Scummvm

A program which allows you to run certain classic graphical adventure and role-playing games, provided you already have their data files. The clever part about this: ScummVM just replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed. ScummVM is a complete rewrite of these games' executables and is not an emulator.
