# Sealskin

A self-hosted, client-server platform that enables users to run powerful, containerized desktop applications streamed directly to a web browser. It uses a browser extension to intercept user actions—such as clicking a link or downloading a file and redirects them to a secure, isolated application environment running on a remote server.
