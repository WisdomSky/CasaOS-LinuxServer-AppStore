| 23 | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxserver/docker-templates/master/linuxserver.io/img/cops-icon.png" width="15"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Cops](https://github.com/WisdomSky/CasaOS-LinuxServer-AppStore/tree/main/Apps/Cops) | 2.5.0 | By Sébastien Lucas, now maintained by MikesPub, stands for Calibre OPDS (and HTML) Php Server. COPS links to your Calibre library database and allows downloading and emailing of books directly from a web browser and provides a OPDS feed to connect to your devices. Changes in your Calibre library are reflected immediately in your COPS pages. See : COPS's home for more details. Don't forget to check the Wiki. ## Why. (taken from the author's site) In my opinion Calibre is a marvelous tool but is too big and has too much dependencies to be used for its content server. That's the main reason why I coded this OPDS server. I needed a simple tool to be installed on a small server (Seagate Dockstar in my case). I initially thought of Calibre2OPDS but as it generate static file no search was possible. Later I added an simple HTML catalog that should be usable on my Kobo. So COPS's main advantages are : * No need for many dependencies. * No need for a lot of CPU or RAM. * Not much code. * Search is available. * With Dropbox / owncloud it's very easy to have an up to date OPDS server. * It was fun to code. If you want to use the OPDS feed don't forget to specify feed. Php at the end of your URL. |
